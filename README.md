# Simple Keylogger (Python)

This is a basic keylogger built using Python and the `pynput` module.

## How it works:
- It captures and logs all key presses.
- The output is saved in a file called `keylog.txt`.

## Example Typed Text:
While the keylogger was running, the following sentence was typed in TextEdit:

**This is a test to check if the keylogger is working correctly.**

## Output:
This sentence was logged in `keylog.txt`, proving that the keylogger worked successfully.
